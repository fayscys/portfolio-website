                        <hr>
                        <p>A third-year student studying Electronics and Computer engineering, year-four starts december 2023, so I guess I can say I'm in year-four :).I roughly started programming around 2020, I figured the tech world is a place to explore the actual world through the eyes of technology. As someone who hasn't been anywhere physically I have related with a lot of people around the world, learnt about cultures, languages and many more through the tech world created by amazing people. I decided to join the tech world to also contribute in any little way I can to create really cool yet informative apps, websites and many more.</p>
                        <p>I have worked with teams, met really exceptional people and it has been an amazing experience. Yes, there are ups and downs but it's worth it in my experience</p>
